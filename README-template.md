## My process
i have used css and html as separate files and i had challenges on maaking the page responsive like 
i was failing to control the card's dimensional but the description paragraph would enlarge the card instead of conforming to the card's dimension
so i used <br> tag

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
 
 
### What I learned
i have learnt how to use word-wrapper css property
and also how i can use the media Query
 i have also learnt about the box-shadow concepts
### Continued development

 i want to improve on laying out elements 

 

### Useful resources
i used blackbox.ai for some of the box shadow conceprts (offsetx,offsety,radius,color)
